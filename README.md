- 👋 Hi, I’m Mike!  **Welcome! My repo is under construction while I am in the Metis data science bootcamp. Please check out my projects, but keep in mind I will be thoroughly cleaning, refactoring, and organizing my code throughout April 2021. I also plan to build on top of some of my projects, including a streamlit app for my covid classification project and a tableau dashboard for my forecasting project. Thank you!**
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, green tech, rock climbing, and making the perfect hummus.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Facebook Prophet for my time series project on forecasting electricity demand.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on clean energy projects! Happy to help environmental nonprofits with their data management and analysis.
