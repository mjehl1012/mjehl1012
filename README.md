- 👋 Hi, I’m Mike!  **Welcome! My repo is under construction over the next couple of weeks. Please check out my public projects, but keep in mind I will be thoroughly cleaning, refactoring, and organizing my code in early to mid May 2021. Thank you!**
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, green tech, rock climbing, and making the perfect hummus.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about AMI data as I apply for data jobs in the clean energy space.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on clean energy projects! Happy to help environmental nonprofits with their data management and analysis.
