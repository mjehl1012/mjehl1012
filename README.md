- 👋 Hi, I’m Mike!  
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, clean energy, rock climbing, sketch comedy, leadership in turbulent times, and a few other things.
- 🌱 I spend a lot of my time manipulating energy data to better understand how to modernize the grid.
- 💞️ I just wrapped up my Fellowship in the Clean Energy Leadership Institute, where I gained a wealth of knowledge and made lasting friendships with other climate-minded professionals looking to make a dent in the climate crisis this decade.
